## Securing the Application:
The API key was accessed securely using Netlify functions to prevent exposure on the client-side. This was accomplished by adjusting the API logic through Netlify functions. I chose Netlify functions to securely hide the API key, eliminating the need for a dedicated backend. These functions, provided by Netlify and known as serverless or lambda functions, allow the deployment of server-side code or backend logic without the requirement of a dedicated server.

## Development Journey
The development of Weather Sense involved a deep dive into the world of APIs, focusing on integrating and utilizing the OpenWeather API. This process honed the skills of handling external data sources and translating them into user-friendly formats.

## Learning Curve
Navigating the learning curve involved mastering asynchronous JavaScript, a crucial skill in ensuring the efficiency and responsiveness of the application. The ability to proficiently handle asynchronous operations was pivotal, particularly in managing data fetch operations. This skill not only contributed to the seamless functioning of the application but also played a vital role in enhancing its overall performance. The acquired proficiency in asynchronous JavaScript represents a key milestone in the learning journey, marking the successful incorporation of a fundamental skill set essential for optimizing the application's functionality.
